/**
 * Status Register
 * This register reflects the state of various functions inside the PPU.
 * It is often used for determining timing. To determine when the PPU has reached a given pixel of the screen,
 * put an opaque (non-transparent) pixel of sprite 0 there.
 * READ ONLY
 *
 *      7  bit  0
 *      ---- ----
 *      VSO. ....
 *      |||| ||||
 *      |||+-++++- PPU open bus. Returns stale PPU bus contents.
 *      ||+------- Sprite overflow. The intent was for this flag to be set
 *      ||         whenever more than eight sprites appear on a scanline, but a
 *      ||         hardware bug causes the actual behavior to be more complicated
 *      ||         and generate false positives as well as false negatives; see
 *      ||         PPU sprite evaluation. This flag is set during sprite
 *      ||         evaluation and cleared at dot 1 (the second dot) of the
 *      ||         pre-render line.
 *      |+-------- Sprite 0 Hit.  Set when a nonzero pixel of sprite 0 overlaps
 *      |          a nonzero background pixel; cleared at dot 1 of the pre-render
 *      |          line.  Used for raster timing.
 *      +--------- Vertical blank has started (0: not in vblank; 1: in vblank).
 *                  Set at dot 1 of line 241 (the line *after* the post-render
 *                  line); cleared after reading $2002 and at dot 1 of the
 *                  pre-render line.
